<p><strong>18) Classify Ad and Process</strong></p>
<p>Customersare the only users who are allowed to post classify ads for their desire services. To ensure satisfaction interactions between the Customer and the Service Providers, establishing clear communication between the parties is extremely important.When creating and posting classify ads, hiring or rejecting Service Provider request to &ldquo;Provide Service&rdquo; you understand and agree to apply the followingguide lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Creating and Posting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photo and/or Video:</strong> We understand that not every service may need a BEFORE and/or AFTER photo or video description, however we strongly recommend that you use BEFORE and/or AFTER photo or videos of the servicefor classify adsas you see fit.Photos and/or videoshelp Service Providers to have some visual for your desired service. It sparks the interest of Service Providersand probably may encourage them to request to &ldquo;provide service&rdquo; to you. Classify ads with aBEFORE and/or AFTER photo and/or video has a higher chance of being noticedby Service Providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Ad Title:</strong> The headline of your ad is extremely important, that&rsquo;s why we encourage you to use key words that will describe your service need to the best of your ability (e.g. &ldquo;Dog walker needed&rdquo;, &ldquo;I need my hair color&rdquo;, &ldquo;My lawn needs you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Residence need to Move&rdquo; and etc. you got the point). You Must have a title to best describe the service of need.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Distance Ratio:</strong> If you need the Service Provider traveling to you, please take into consideration the distance they may have to travel to you especially when you are setting your budget limit on your ad. Be considerate and include travel time in your budget and if you are traveling to the Service Provider make sure to consider the distance and be on time. It is your responsibility to research the time each distance may take before you make any decision on hiring the Service Provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Budget Limits:</strong> Treat others as you will want them to treat you. Before you set your budget limits for your desire service we recommend that you research prices of such service, then decide on how bad you need the service. We encourage you to stay within you budget limit but be courteous, realistic and fair when you decide on your affordable budget limit.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No Negotiating and No Hassle: </strong>KeeHee forbids any forms of Negotiating or Hassle to all users. All classified ad is as posted and should not be altered in any ways upon rendering of service. The information described on the classifiedad should be honor as describe. The date of service needed should be honored by the Service Provider and should not exceed the service due date. The Service Provider should render service as described in the classify ad description with no negation and no hassle to the Customer in any way, form or fashion. We recommend that Service Providershould provide more service to the customer than the Customer expected or requested because more quality service is highly recommended. At KeeHee we believe that more service is better but less is never accepted. Under no circumstance should a Service Provider negotiate or hassle a customer in regards of pricing. The price posted on the ad is the only price that the customer is obligated to pay for the service. Violating any of these terms is grounds for immediate termination to a user&rsquo;s account.</li>
